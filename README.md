# MTN MoMo Reverse Transaction Intercept and Modify Demigod


      
## Description
This script poses a severe security risk and should be handled with great caution. It is designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the MTN mobile money (MoMo) Cameroon service, allowing an attacker to intercept and modify the reversal transaction, potentially resulting in the unauthorized gain of a significantly larger sum than the original transaction amount. For instance, an attacker could send 100 FRS to the victim and then maliciously modify the reversal transaction to reflect 400,000 FRS, leading to an erroneous reversal of 400,000 FRS.

## Requirements
- **Bash**: Ensure that you have Bash installed on your system.
- **cURL**: The script relies on cURL for making HTTP requests.
- **Dialog**: The script uses Dialog for user input with a graphical interface.

## How to Run
To run the script, simply execute the following command in your terminal:
bash
$ bash MTN_MoMo_Rev_tx_intercept_and_modify_Demigod.sh
The script will then prompt you for the reverse transaction ID. Once provided, it will execute a series of USSD commands to complete the reversal process.

It's critical to reiterate that any unauthorized usage of this script is illegal and unethical. The potential for substantial financial harm is significant, and misuse could lead to severe legal consequences. Under no circumstances should this script be applied for malicious purposes.
